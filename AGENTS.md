# AGENTS.md — operating instructions for an AI agent

You have been pointed at this repository and asked to install and run it. This file is
self-contained. Read it end to end, then execute the numbered steps in order. You should not
need to read `README.md`, `PLAN.md` or `investigation-log.md` first — they are for humans, and
several of them contain superseded reasoning that will mislead you.

## What this is

A locally-runnable mock of the HL7 DaVinci prior-authorization flow: **CRD → DTR → PAS**.
Six upstream DaVinci services run as ordinary background processes. No container runtime.
(Run this way, the stack runs on *your* host, per steps 1–6 below.)

If you were handed the **LXC drop-in image** instead of a bare checkout, the whole stack —
IRIS, the six services, their toolchains and the built frontends — already runs *inside* the
container at `/opt/davinci-mock`, started by the container's own systemd units. There is no
provisioning step, nothing runs on your host, `lxc-start` is the whole flow, and the entry
point is **<http://10.0.3.108:3001/>**. See `LXC-DROPIN.md` for that path.

Success looks like this, and only this: a human opens <http://localhost:3001/>, clicks through
a coverage card, logs in at a Keycloak login page, fills a questionnaire, presses
**Proceed To Prior Auth**, and watches a claim go `Pending` then `Granted` in the browser.

## Hard rules

1. **No credentials exist and none are needed.** Do not ask the user for a token, an API key,
   an account or a `.env` file. There is nothing to supply. See "Credentials" below for the
   complete inventory — if something is not in that table, it is a bug, not a missing input.
2. **Do not edit `versions.lock`.** It is the pin set and the de facto run version. A changed
   SHA invalidates every result you report.
3. **Do not use `/tmp`** for anything belonging to this project. It has been wiped once and
   took the entire toolchain with it. Build artefacts, caches and scratch all go under the
   repository or under the cache directory named by `GRADLE_USER_HOME` / `VSAC_CACHE_DIR`.
4. **Never export a global `PORT`.** See trap 1. `bin/up.sh` passes `PORT` per service.
5. **Never `pkill -f <pattern>`** on this box. See trap 5. It will match the shell running it.
6. **Do not delete or move a published git tag.** A tag is the record of a certified run.
7. **Report only what you verified.** If a driver did not run, say so. A plausible claim that
   was not measured is worse than an honest gap.

## Credentials — the complete inventory

Everything the stack authenticates against, in full. There is nothing else.

| What | Value | Source | Action needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Keycloak admin | `admin` / `admin` | default in `bin/env.sh`, used once at boot to import the realm | none |
| Keycloak demo user | `dtr` / `dtr-demo` | `fixtures/keycloak/BurdenReduction-realm.json` | none — `e2e-browser.py` types it |
| Keycloak client secret | `#replaceMe#` | same fixture; a literal upstream placeholder | none |
| PAS FHIR client | none | PAS runs `BYPASS_AUTH=true`, issues its own token from H2 | none |
| GitHub | none | origin = `Aidentech-com/davinci-mock` (unchanged, unpushed). Active repo: **`Aidentech-com/iris-fhir`** (public) — remote `iris-fhir`, created + pushed 2026-09-30 as the project's home under the LXC machine's name; flipped public 2026-09-30 (later) to serve the distributable LXC image release to end users (`bin/lxc-import.sh download` by default — single file from https://download.aidentech.com; `bin/lxc-import.sh github` for the release parts). Image parts live as release assets on this repo | none |
| `VSAC_API_KEY` | absent | optional; without it 67 value sets do not resolve | none — omit it |
| IRIS FHIR OAuth confidential client | auto-generated id/secret in `bin/env.sh` (`IRIS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`/`_SECRET`) | created by `ConfigureInternalOAuthClients()` when the `iris-fhir` container was provisioned; local mock fixture, same standing as Keycloak's `admin/admin` — it only authorizes against the container's internal OAuth server | none — needed by `bin/ehr-shim` and `bin/seed-iris.sh` |

The stack needs no secrets because the two services that could demand them are configured not
to: PAS runs with `BYPASS_AUTH=true`, and CRD runs `use_oauth: false` with `checkJwt: false`.
IRIS is reached only through `bin/ehr-shim`, which holds the confidential client and mints a
`client_credentials` bearer token (`aud` = the FHIR base URL) for every upstream call, so the
browser never needs an IRIS token.
Keycloak exists solely so the DTR launch performs a real OIDC redirect through a real login
page, which is what makes the browser path genuinely end to end.

The only external fetches are the six **public** upstream DaVinci repositories and their
Maven/npm dependencies, all pinned to exact SHAs in `versions.lock`.

## Step 1 — check the host

```bash
. /etc/os-release; echo "$PRETTY_NAME"        # expect Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
node --version                                # expect v22.x  (provision.sh asserts this)
ls /usr/lib/jvm/                              # need a JDK 21 for Keycloak
python3 --version
df -h .                                       # need ~3 GB free
free -h                                       # 7 GB total is the working minimum
id -u                                         # if NOT 0, see below before step 2
```

If Node is missing or the wrong major, stop and say so. Neither upstream `package.json`
declares `engines`, so the wrong major does not fail cleanly — it produces opaque ESM errors
much later, and the agent will waste a cycle blaming something else.

**If `id -u` is not 0, the stock paths will not work.** `bin/env.sh` defaults Keycloak to
`/opt/keycloak` and the two caches to `/root/.cache/davinci-mock/`, all root-owned, and
`provision.sh` does a bare `mkdir`/`mv` with no privilege handling. Export these in the same
shell that runs the scripts — they are read with `${VAR:-default}`, so a pre-set value wins:

```bash
export KEYCLOAK_HOME="$HOME/.local/keycloak"
export GRADLE_USER_HOME="$HOME/.cache/gradle"
export VSAC_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/vsac"
```

`env.sh` appends the load-bearing trailing slash to `VSAC_CACHE_DIR` itself. Do not re-add or
strip it. Without these three, step 2 dies with a bare `Permission denied` that names neither
the variable nor the step.

## Step 2 — provision

```bash
./bin/provision.sh
./bin/provision.sh --check      # MUST report "all inputs present" and exit 0
```

This installs nothing into your package manager. It unpacks a checksum-verified Temurin
JDK 17 to `runtime/jdk17`, Maven to `runtime/maven`, Keycloak to `$KEYCLOAK_HOME` (default
`/opt/keycloak`, which *is* outside the project folder — see step 1), and clones the six
upstream repos at their pinned SHAs. You do not need a system JDK 17 — only Keycloak needs a
system JDK 21.

`--check` is the real gate. If it exits non-zero, the run cannot succeed; report its output
verbatim rather than proceeding. Note that a green `--check` proves the *inputs* are present —
it says nothing about whether the services start. Those are different failures and you should
not conflate them.

Expect 10–20 minutes, and do not assume a timeout means failure. A cold first start that builds
two React frontends is genuinely slow. If you must bound it, allow at least 40 minutes for
`up.sh --reset` before concluding anything is wrong.

## Step 3 — start

```bash
./bin/up.sh
```

Then confirm all six are actually up — **do not trust the script's own summary**, because
`up.sh` can report success while a service is wedged. Use the same probes `up.sh` uses, which
are the endpoints that actually answer rather than the ones you would guess:

```bash
while read -r name port route; do
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' --max-time 5 "http://localhost:$port$route" || echo 000)
  printf '  %-12s %s  %s  %s\n' "$name" "$port" "$code" "$route"
done <<'EOF'
keycloak     8180 /realms/BurdenReduction/.well-known/openid-configuration
ehr-shim     8080 /fhir/r4/metadata
crd          8090 /r4/cds-services
prior-auth   9015 /fhir/metadata
dtr          3005 /
crg          3001 /
EOF
```

All six must be `200`. Note the paths: `/fhir/r4/metadata` on 8080, `/fhir/metadata` on 9015
(not `/metadata`), and `/r4/cds-services` on 8090. A `404` on those means you guessed the
path, **not** that the service is down. `8080` is now `bin/ehr-shim` (Node) standing in for
test-ehr in front of the IRIS FHIR server in the `iris-fhir` LXC container — a `200` there
proves the shim can mint an IRIS token and proxy the CapabilityStatement. `3001` is the one
that matters most: crg serves its runtime URLs from `/env-config`, so if that is missing the
browser will call the wrong hosts even though `/` works.

A `200` on all six is necessary and not sufficient. `up.sh` also runs post-flight checks —
dtr's `/clients` being non-empty, CRD actually advertising the `order-sign-crd` hook, the
value-set cache being reachable at CRD's concatenated path, and CRD's write-once
doc-needed flag being warmed (see "Known, accepted limitations"); the warmup is the
check that would wave a poisoned CRD through. Read its output; those are the failures a
naive probe waves through.

A `000` on `8180` almost always means Keycloak never imported the realm. The usual cause is
JDK 21 missing — `kc.sh` runs `$JAVA_HOME/bin/java`, and `env.sh` points `JAVA_HOME` at the
provisioned JDK 17, so `up.sh` has to override it per service. It is handled, but if you see
Keycloak fail, check that override first.

## Step 4 — verify

Both drivers. Both are required; neither covers the other.

```bash
./bin/demo.sh                       # 12 assertions, API only    -> 12 passed, 0 failed
./.venv/bin/python bin/e2e-browser.py  # 14 assertions, real browser -> 14 passed, 0 failed
```

`demo.sh` covers the API surface. It **cannot** cover the browser leg, and this is the single
most important thing to know about this repository: *dtr submits the Claim, not the EHR.*
Pressing **Proceed To Prior Auth** makes dtr's `QuestionnaireForm.outputResponse("completed")`
build a `Claim` from the QuestionnaireResponse, hand it to a `PriorAuth` panel, and only that
panel's `Submit` issues the `Claim/$submit` from the browser. Nothing in crg or test-ehr
references PAS at all, so grepping those two repositories for the PAS port returns nothing and
the browser leg looks impossible. It is not. `demo.sh` posts its own Claim and therefore can
never cover it; the two drivers submit *different* claims and neither is redundant.

`e2e-browser.py` needs Playwright, which the stack itself does not. Ubuntu 24.04
is PEP-668 "externally managed", so a bare `pip install playwright` is refused —
install it into a venv:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv
python3 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/pip install playwright
./.venv/bin/playwright install --with-deps chromium \
  || ./.venv/bin/playwright install chromium     # --with-deps runs apt-get update
ADVERTISE_HOST=10.0.3.108 ./.venv/bin/python bin/e2e-browser.py
```

If that install is unavailable, report the API result (12/12) and state plainly that the
browser leg was not run. Do not infer it from `demo.sh`.

## Step 5 — report

State, explicitly:

- both driver results as pass counts, not adjectives;
- which services answered and on which ports;
- anything you could not verify, and why.

Then hand the user <http://localhost:3001/> and the browser walkthrough in `README.md`.

## Step 6 — stopping

```bash
./bin/down.sh              # stop all six
./bin/down.sh --purge      # also drop PAS and DTR state
```

`down.sh` sweeps the six ports and verifies ownership before killing anything, because the
recorded PIDs are not reliable: `mvn spring-boot:run` execs a separate JVM and Gradle
`bootRun` runs in a daemon tree, so the recorded process can die while its children keep the
port bound. Trust the port sweep, not the PID file. It leaves unrelated services alone — there
is a Next.js app on `:3000` on some machines that must survive.

## Traps that produce convincing but wrong results

These are ordered by how much time they cost. Most of them make something *look* healthy.

1. **A global `PORT=3001`** intended for crg silently drags dtr onto 3001, because dtr's
   `bin/www` reads `PORT` *before* `REACT_APP_SERVER_PORT`. crg then dies `EADDRINUSE` — and
   the stack still probes green, because dtr answers `/` with 200. Always pass `PORT` per
   service, never export it.
2. **`up.sh` reporting success.** It probes. See step 3; probe independently.
3. **A green `demo.sh` with Keycloak dead.** Every API-level test in this repo runs with
   `use_oauth: false` and `checkJwt: false`, so nothing asks Keycloak for a token. The stack
   will pass 12/12 with `:8180` completely dead and only fail on the first browser click.
   Absence of failure in the tests you ran is not evidence of absence in the paths you did not
   run.
4. **A green run that is not reproducible.** `e2e-browser.py` clears
   `docs/screenshots/e2e/` at the start of every run, so a green run always leaves
   `git status` dirty on some PNGs — 08 and 09 always, and 02/04/07 often. This is expected.
   `git checkout -- docs/screenshots/e2e/` restores the committed set. Do not commit whatever
   the last run produced, and do not report the dirty tree as a problem.
5. **`pkill -f <pattern>`** matches the command line of the shell invoking it, so it kills the
   agent's own shell — and takes a service down as collateral. Kill by PID, or use a pattern
   the invoking command cannot match. This has already happened here once.
6. **The VSAC cache directory losing its trailing slash.** Both file stores build the cache
   path by plain string concatenation, with no separator. Without the slash every value set
   misses while the boot log cheerfully reports all 65 as added, and you get a questionnaire
   with zero answer options. `env.sh` enforces the slash; do not remove that.
7. **CDS-Library placement is per-service and getting it wrong is a hard exit.** CRD needs the
   *whole* library at `repos/CRD/server/CDS-Library/`. PAS needs only `PriorAuth/`, at
   `repos/prior-auth/CDS-Library/`. Do not run `embedCdsLibrary` — it deletes the directory and
   re-clones unpinned master.
8. **CORS.** Upstream's `corsOrigins` list is 3000/3002/3005 and does **not** include 3001, so
   a browser on 3001 is CORS-blocked by CRD. `env.sh` sets `CORS_ORIGINS`, and relaxed binding
   *replaces* the whole list rather than appending — so if you override it, you must re-list
   every origin you still need.
9. **`security.auth_redirect_host` must stay empty** in the Keycloak realm config. Upstream
   uses the value as the full `scheme://host:port` prefix, so a bare hostname produces a
   `redirect_uri` with no scheme and Keycloak rejects it. Empty means "derive from the
   request", which is both correct and DHCP-proof.
10. **The realm needs 26 SMART client scopes** or Keycloak rejects the `authorize` request
    outright. The scope list the DTR UI sends is not standard OIDC, so this is not guessable.

## Known, accepted limitations

State these if asked; do not try to fix them.

- CRD cannot resolve the CQL references `ALTERNATIVE_THERAPY`,
  `RESULT_QuestionnaireAdditionalUri` and `RESULT_QuestionnairePARequestUri` in
  `HomeBloodGlucoseMonitorRule`, so the dtr form arrives un-prefilled. Upstream defect.
- **CRD's `hasDocNeededExtension` caches its result on the singleton, write-once, per boot.**
  The first `order-sign-crd` POST after CRD starts decides whether responses ever carry
  `systemActions` (the `"Complete … in DTR"` button source). A request that degrades to the
  summary card — the prefetch-less `fixtures/order-sign-prefetch.json` (demo step 1) throws
  `RequestIncompleteException` — caches `false`, and *every* later response silently drops
  `systemActions`, so crg never renders the launch button and the browser E2E fails at the
  SMART launch even though the API drivers pass. Upstream defect, unmasked by the IRIS swap.
  `up.sh` post-flight now **warms the flag first** (POSTs `fixtures/order-sign-warmup.json`,
  a real prefetch-carrying request) and fails loud if `systemActions` comes back empty —
  the recovery is a CRD restart so the warmup is the first POST. Once warmed `true`, the
  flag never changes, so demo.sh and the e2e are safe in any order.
- Without a `VSAC_API_KEY`, 67 value sets do not resolve and value-set-gated CDS rules cannot
  fire.
- The full prior-auth decision takes about 15 seconds (`DELAY=15000` in `env.sh`).
- Linux only. Windows and macOS are not supported.

## LXC drop-in image (maintenance notes)

The `iris-fhir` LXC container ships as a distributable image (release assets on
`Aidentech-com/iris-fhir`; end-user default source is the single file at
`https://download.aidentech.com/iris-fhir-image.tar.gz`, with
`bin/lxc-import.sh github` as the sidecar-carrying alternate). The installer
never starts
or restarts `lxc-net`; it checks the bridge the image needs (default
`lxcbr0` @ `10.0.3.1`, or any custom bridge via `--bridge`/`--container-ip`,
e.g. `br0` on a 192-series), re-pins the image to a custom network before the
first start, and walks the user through every step
(`Press Enter to accept, or x to exit`; `--yes` for unattended). On a custom
bridge the re-pin keeps the baked `10.0.3.108` as a **secondary** eth0
address: IRIS's OAuth token metadata self-references
`https://10.0.3.108:52774` and every JWT-protected FHIR read validates by
reaching it — drop it and reads hang while `/oauth2/token` keeps answering
(verified 2026-10-10). It is
**self-contained**: the six-service stack, its toolchains and the built
frontends all live inside the container at `/opt/davinci-mock`, Keycloak at
`/opt/keycloak`. The end user runs `lxc-start`; the host runs nothing. Full
end-user walkthrough: `LXC-DROPIN.md`.

Distribution: the single file is served to end users at
`https://download.aidentech.com/iris-fhir-image.tar.gz` (~4.2 GB, live-verified
2026-10-10). The download link serves **no** `.sha256` sidecar, so the
installer warns and skips the checksum on that path — the GitHub `dropin-v2`
release keeps the sidecars for a verified pull. R2 was tried and explicitly
abandoned (`wrangler r2 object put` defaults to local emulation and its
`--file` cap is 300 MiB; the account-visible bucket tied to
`download.aidentech.com` is owner-managed — do not touch it).

Boot sequence inside the container (no host systemd involvement):

- `iris.service` (enabled) starts IRIS (`iris start FHIR`).
- `davinci-stack.service` (enabled, `After=iris.service`) runs
  `/usr/local/bin/davinci-stack start` → waits for IRIS TLS 200 → `bin/up.sh` →
  `bin/seed-iris.sh`. Log: `/var/log/davinci-stack.log`.
- Browser entry point is **<http://10.0.3.108:3001/>** — the container's static
  bridge IP. LXC 5.0.3 has no proxy device, so the image pins `10.0.3.108` via
  `/etc/netplan/10-lxc.yaml` and every service binds `0.0.0.0`.
- **The host CPU must have AVX, AVX2, BMI1 and BMI2.** IRIS 2024.x is compiled
  against them; on a CPU without them `iris.service` dies with a `SIGILL` core
  dump at boot and nothing comes up (measured on a Core 2 Quad Q9650 — flags
  only `cx16 sse2 ssse3`). `bin/lxc-import.sh` step 1 gates on this and aborts
  before the download; it is a hardware requirement — a container cannot
  emulate instructions the host CPU lacks, so re-importing on the same box
  cannot help. First symptom to suspect this for: `systemctl status iris.service`
  → `code=dumped, status=4/ILL`.

If you repackage it:

- `bin/lxc-image-build.sh` trims cruft but the trim must **never** delete
  `IRIS.WIJ`, the journal files, or `journal.log` (IRIS's journal-HISTORY log).
  Deleting the WIJ or journal.log makes the next boot abort into single-user
  journal-recovery mode ("Startup aborted, entering single user mode") — both
  were hit on 2026-09-30 and recovered via `iris session FHIR -B` →
  `Do ^STURECOV` → option 8 (reset so journal is not restored at startup) →
  `iris force FHIR` → `iris start FHIR`. `^SHUTDOWN`'s prompts read `/dev/tty`
  and cannot be driven from a pipe; the `iris.stop` ExecStop inside the baked-in
  `iris.service` handles that with a pty.
- **Four things must be in the container before packaging** (all present now):
  1. `bin/provision.sh --check` green *inside* the container. As of 2026-10-10
     this also means CDS-Library is placed — `provision.sh` step 1b copies CRD's
     *whole* library to `repos/CRD/server/CDS-Library/` and PAS's `PriorAuth/`
     to `repos/prior-auth/CDS-Library/`. It was previously done by hand and
     never scripted, so a fresh clone boot-failed (CRD "Failed to reload from
     folder: CDS-Library/CRD-DTR/", PAS NPE in `populateRulesTable`).
  2. The JDK 21 `/etc` dependencies for Keycloak: `/etc/java-21-openjdk/` and
     `/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts`. Debian's JDK package symlinks its config and
     truststore there; `provision.sh` installs Keycloak but not these, and
     without them `kc.sh` dies loading `java.security` (first) or with "could
     not find the system truststore" (second) — both hit 2026-10-10, both fixed
     by copying the two `/etc` trees in.
  3. The six services built (`node_modules`, dtr/crg frontends) so first boot is
     fast and offline. `bin/up.sh` now runs `npm ci` itself if `node_modules` is
     missing, so a trimmed image still recovers.
  4. The in-container autostart installed: `bin/lxc-install-autostart.sh` (run
     *inside* the container) installs `/usr/local/bin/davinci-stack` from
     `bin/davinci-stack-container.sh` and enables
     `fixtures/lxc/davinci-stack.service`. Both are in the repo now — the
     controller/unit had been hand-placed and were unversioned until 2026-10-10.
- **`bin/up.sh` pins `KC_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0` for Keycloak.** Measured 2026-10-10:
  the identical `kc.sh start-dev` command bound `0.0.0.0` when launched by hand
  but `127.0.0.1` when launched by the boot unit, and a loopback bind passes
  every `localhost:8180` probe while breaking the browser's redirect to
  `ADVERTISE_HOST:8180` (the SMART launch sends the browser to Keycloak). If
  `8180` ever reads `000` from the host but `200` inside, check that pin.
- The image is only shippable after a **clean** cold-boot re-verify —
  `lxc-stop` → `lxc-start` and nothing else: both units `active`, all six probes
  `200` from the host via `10.0.3.108`, `grep -c "Startup aborted" messages.log`
  = 0, and both drivers green (`demo.sh` 12/12 in-container; `e2e-browser.py`
  14/14 from the host with `ADVERTISE_HOST=10.0.3.108`).
- `iris list` shows `state: warn` — expected (HealthShare failover context has
  no mirror partner; benign). IRIS auto-starts at container boot via the unit.

## If something is genuinely wrong

Before escalating, re-run `./bin/provision.sh --check`. A surprising share of "the stack is
broken" reports are actually a missing input, a service that never finished building, or one
of the ten traps above. `TEST-FLOW.md` has the full runbook and a per-symptom table; `logs/`
has one log per service. Quote the actual error text — do not paraphrase a failure you have
not read.
