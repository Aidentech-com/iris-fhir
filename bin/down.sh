# A recorded PID is not necessarily the process holding the port:
#   - `mvn spring-boot:run` is a shell script that execs a SEPARATE JVM, so the
#     JVM survives its parent.
#   - Gradle's `bootRun` runs inside a daemon-launched process tree.
# Killing the recorded process group therefore reports "stopped" while all five
# ports stay bound. The ports are the contract, so sweep them.
#
# Safety: only ever kill a listener that belongs to this project. Two signals,
# because neither alone is enough:
#   - the command line, which for the JVMs carries the full classpath under
#     $DAVINCI_ROOT, but for Node is just `node ./bin/prod` (relative paths);
#   - the working directory, read from /proc/<pid>/cwd, which is the repo dir.
# The unrelated Next.js app on :3000 shares this box and must not be touched.
